# A machine which is controlled by another machine is known as AI

# Neural Networks types
# CNN, RNN, ANN

# CNN - Image oriented processing
# RNN - Data Oriented like Sentimental analysis
# ANN - Data oriented

# NLP - Natural language processing - Library used nltk

# NLP used Count vectorizer and Term frequency to the sentence
# Data wrangling in NLP is known as Text preprocessing

# Parts of speech is to used to identify a sentence Example - I am not play cricket in this not is an negative word and
# good is an positive so the model will get confused so we use POS

#                                                  Text Preprocessing(NLP)                                             #

# Flow of Text preprocessing-----------------[]

# Tokenization - Converts a string of sentence into separate individual words Example-India is my country -->
# --> ["India","is","my',"country"]

# Lower case - Converting all the sentence and words to lowercase is because python is a case sensitive language which
# understands as 2 different words. Example - Is and is

# Stopwords - Process of removing unwanted words from a sentence. Example -  I am very good in this I am.., is stop word
# which reduces the efficiency of the model.

# Stemming - Process of converting the words to its root word of the same meaning. Example - Plays, Playing, Played
# in this Play is root word play which has same meaning. Another Example - Shower, Showering, Showered in this while
# using Stemming the root word is Shower but some times the out come may br show

# Lemmatization - Process of converting the words to its root word of the same meaning. But the  accuracy is higher
# when compared to stemming becuase it uses POS to understand and conert
